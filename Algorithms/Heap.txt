//Removing(also called extractMax)
1: Swap the first value in the values property with the last one.
2: POP from the values property, so you can return the value at the end.
3: Have the new root "sink down" to the correct spot..!
    =>Your parent index start at 0(the root).
    => Find the index of the left child: 2*index+1 (make sure its not out of the bounds)
    => Find the index of the right child: 2*index+2 (make sure its not out of bounds)
    => If the left or right child is greater than the element...swap. If both left and right children are larger, swap with the largest child.
    => The child index you swapped to now becomes the new parent index.
    => Keep looping and swapping until neither child is larger than the element.
    => Return the old root!
